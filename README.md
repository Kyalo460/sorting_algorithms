I'll be exploring the various types of Big O notation while I
design 4 well known sorting algorithms in C.

The Algorithms are:
- Bubble-sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Quick sort

The Big O notations for each algorithm will be stored in the file
*-O, where * will be replaced with the number that starts the
algrothm's file name. The list of Big O notations will be in the order:
. Best case
. Average case
. Worst case

All the prototypes will be stored in the file sort.h
